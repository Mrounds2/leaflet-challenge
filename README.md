# leaflet-challenge

in screenshot #1, it shows the world overview of all the data points that I collected.
in screenshot #2, it shows a closer look at north america with more finer data points.

the top right corner shows a layer tab, but I was unsuccessful in creating layers
I also couldnt figure out how to get a color gradient legend to show in the bottom right
